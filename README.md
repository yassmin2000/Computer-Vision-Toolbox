# Edge And Boundary Detection 

**Description:**  
This Desktop app provides various image processing techniques, including filtering, edge detection, line detection, ellipse detection, and snake active contour, on standard grayscale and color images. The app allows you to add noise, apply filters, detect edges, draw histograms, equalize images, perform normalization, thresholding, transform color images to grayscale, implement frequency domain filters (high pass and low pass), and create hybrid images. Additionally, it includes line detection, ellipse detection, and snake active contour algorithms for advanced image analysis.



## Features:
1. **Additive Noise:** Implement uniform, Gaussian, and salt & pepper noise addition to the image.
2. **Filtering:** Apply average, Gaussian, and median filters to the noisy image.
3. **Edge Detection:** Detect edges using Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny edge detectors.
4. **Line Detection:** Implement line detection using Hough transform.
5. **Circle Detection:** Implement circle detection using Hough transform.
6. **Ellipse Detection:** Implement ellipse detection using Hough transform.
7. **Snake Active Contour:** Implement snake active contour for image segmentation.
8. **Histogram and Distribution Curve:** Draw histograms and distribution curves for the images.
9. **Equalization:** Perform histogram equalization on the image.
10. **Normalization:** Normalize the image.
11. **Local and Global Thresholding:** Implement local and global thresholding techniques.
12. **Color to Grayscale Transformation:** Transform color images to grayscale and plot histograms of R, G, and B channels with their distribution functions.
13. **Frequency Domain Filters:** Implement high pass and low pass filters in the frequency domain.
14. **Hybrid Images:** Create hybrid images.


## Code Implementation:
The provided code implements the above tasks using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface and various image processing libraries such as OpenCV for image manipulation. It includes classes and methods representing each of the previous features.

## Instructions:
1. Run the `mainwindow.py` script to start the application.
2. Load the standard grayscale or color image by double-clicking on the appropriate graphics view.
3. Perform desired tasks using the provided options and buttons in the interface.
4. View the processed images and analysis results in the graphics views.
5. Experiment with different parameters and techniques to observe their effects on the images.
